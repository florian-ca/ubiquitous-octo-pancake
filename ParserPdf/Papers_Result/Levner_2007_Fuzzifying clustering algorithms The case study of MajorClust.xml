<Abstract> been proposed so far, the most useful are those that automatically reveal the number of clusters and assign each target document to exactly one cluster. However, in many real situations, there not exists an exact boundary between different clusters. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy version of the MajorClust algorithm. The proposed clustering method assigns documents to more than one category by taking into account a membership function for both, edges and nodes of the corresponding underlying graph. Thus, the clustering problem is formulated in terms of weighted fuzzy graphs. The fuzzy approach permits to decrease some negative effects which appear in clustering of large-sized corpora with noisy data.</Abstract>
<Introduction>
Clustering analysis refers to the partitioning of a data set into subsets (clusters),
so that the data in each subset (ideally) share some common trait, often proximity, according to some defined distance measure [1,2,3]. Clustering methods are
usually classified with respect to their underlying algorithmic approaches: hierarchical, iterative (or partitional) and density based are some instances belonging
to this classification. Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established ones, whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters
at once. Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative (“bottom-up”) or divisive
(“top-down”); agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate
cluster and merge them into successively larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters.
Iterative algorithms start with some initial clusters (their number either being
unknown in advance or given a priori) and intend to successively improve the
existing cluster set by changing their “representatives” (“centers of gravity”,
“centroids”) , like in K-Means [3] or by iterative node-exchanging (like in [4]).
